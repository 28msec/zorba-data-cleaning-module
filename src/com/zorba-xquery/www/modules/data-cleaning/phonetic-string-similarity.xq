 : This library module provides phonetic string similarity functions, comparing strings with basis on how they sound.
 : 
 : These metrics are particularly effective in matching names, since names are often spelled in different 
 : ways that sound the same.
 : 
 : The logic contained in this module is not specific to any particular XQuery implementation.
