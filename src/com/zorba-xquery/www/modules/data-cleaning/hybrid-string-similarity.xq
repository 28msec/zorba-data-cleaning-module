 : This library module provides hybrid string similarity functions, combining the properties of 
 : character-based string similarity functions and token-based string similarity functions.
 : 
 : The logic contained in this module is not specific to any particular XQuery implementation,
 : although the module requires the trigonometic functions of XQuery 1.1 or a math extension 
 : function such as sqrt($x as numeric) for computing the square root.
